    several operations
*/

//Asks the user for a 4 digit year

//decide if the year/number is divisible by 4
//If it is then move on

//If not then its not a leap year

//Then decide if the year/number is divisible by 100
//If it is then move on

//If not then its not a leap year

//Finally decide if the year/number is divisible by 400
//If it is then report the findings as a leap year

//If not then its not a leap year

//end
